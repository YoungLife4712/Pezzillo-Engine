# Friday Night Funkin' - Pezzillo Engine ALPHA
Engine mede purely out of nowhere just because I had some fun to understand how the FNF Source worked.
This is based on the Psych Engine (https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) by Shadow Mario, originally used on [Mind Games Mod] (https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107).
